# retirementCalculator

This python app calculates a retirement trajectory given user inputs such as age, salary, interest rate, etc.

The program will create two files:
  assetChart.png : an image file containing your trajectory graph
  rt_defaults.txt : a file containing default inputs once saved by the user
Neither file is required for the program to work.

The opening window has text boxes for user input:
![Alt text](/screenshots/OpeningWindow.png?raw=true "Opening window")

After pressing compute, a graph is displayed. Panes provide additional detail on the computation
