# retirementCalculator

This python app calculates a retirement trajectory given user inputs such as age, salary, interest rate, etc.

The program will create two files:
  assetChart.png : an image file containing your trajectory graph
  rt_defaults.txt : a file containing default inputs once saved by the user
Neither file is required for the program to work.
