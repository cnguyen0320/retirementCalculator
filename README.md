# retirementCalculator

## Description
This python app calculates a retirement trajectory given user inputs such as age, salary, interest rate, etc.

The program will create two files:
  assetChart.png : an image file containing your trajectory graph
  rt_defaults.txt : a file containing default inputs once saved by the user
Neither file is required for the program to work.

## Run instructions
Run the file by typing: `python retirement.py` into terminal or run it in your preferred Python IDE.
